Every task is a thread.

Every thread (also idle) has a thread control block (TCB).

The TCB stores information about the thread. It also stores a pointer to the
next TCB.

All threads form a linked (ring) list. 
The idle threads TCB points to the first thread.
The last threads TCB points to the idle thread.

[idle] -> [t1] -> [t2] -> [t3]
